# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gitree! 🎉

We welcome all kinds of improvements - from bug fixes and formatting to new features and documentation.


## Automatic Issue Assignment

To claim an issue, simply comment on it with one of these keywords:
- `assign me`
- `assign it to me`
- `assign this to me`
- `assign this issue to me`
- `assign the issue to me`

Our automation will check:
1. **Issue availability** - The issue must not already be assigned to someone else
2. **Blocked status** - The issue must not have the `blocked` label
3. **Capacity check** - You can have at most 2 assigned issues without linked PRs

If you pass all checks, the issue will be automatically assigned to you! 🎉

**Note:** Opening a draft PR counts as having a PR linked. This allows you to claim additional issues while working on your current ones.


## Issue Templates

This project uses multiple issue templates to help contributors report issues in a clear and structured way.

When creating a new issue, you will be asked to choose a suitable template such as:

- Bug Report
- Documentation
- Feature Request
- Feature Change Request

Each template contains guided sections (bullet points) that explain what information should be provided.  
Please fill out all relevant sections of the selected template to help maintainers understand and review the issue efficiently.


## Pull Request Template

This project uses a pull request template that is automatically loaded when opening a new pull request.

The template helps contributors include important details such as the related issue number and confirmation that the changes are ready for review.

Please review and complete the pull request template before submitting your PR.  
Following the template helps maintainers review contributions faster and keeps submissions consistent.


## Coding Guidelines

- Follow the existing Python style and structure in the project.

- Add docstrings to functions and comments where appropriate.

- If you add a new feature, include examples in the README where possible.

- Keep your PR focused on a single logical change.


## Blocked Issues Policy

Some issues depend on other work to be completed first. These are marked with:
- A `blocked` label
- A comment listing "Blocked by #..." with the blocking issue number(s)

**What happens if you try to claim a blocked issue?**

If you comment to claim a blocked issue, the automation will:
- Notify you that the issue is blocked
- Suggest up to 5 alternative unblocked issues you can work on instead

**When can you claim a blocked issue?**

Wait until all blocking issues are closed or confirmed resolved. This helps avoid wasted effort and ensures your PR can be properly reviewed.

**Tip:** Always check the issue labels and comments before claiming an issue!
